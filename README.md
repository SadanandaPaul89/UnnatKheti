# UnnatKheti

UnnatKheti is a prototype platform inspired by ISRO's NISAR project. It uses satellite data and AI to deliver district-level crop insights, helping farmers make smarter decisions, reduce costs, and promote sustainable agriculture.

## Features
- District-level crop identification maps  
- AI-powered crop insights  
- Easy-to-use prototype interface  
- Promotes sustainable and efficient farming practices  

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend demo)  
- Placeholder AI/ML integration for future scope  
- Satellite data concepts inspired by NISAR  

## How It Works
1. Simulated satellite data provides district-level insights.  
2. AI models classify crop patterns.  
3. Farmers access visual maps for better planning.  

## Challenges
- Processing large satellite datasets  
- Designing intuitive visual interfaces  
- Building a scalable model for real-world use  

## Future Scope
- Integration with real-time satellite data  
- AI-driven crop yield prediction  
- Mobile-friendly farmer dashboard  

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by geostationary satellites and the NISAR mission by ISRO, focusing on bridging technology with sustainable farming.
